				<h1>Goals for LaunchCode and Resume</h1>
				<p id="introParagraph">With Launchcode, I hope to gain a better understanding of Java and HTML as well as new skillsets
				like JavaScript and CSS. When I make it to LaunchPad I want to learn how to better sell and present myself in resume writing and interview
				skills. I believe my experience in supporting proprietary hardware and software will give me a valuable insight as a developer
				into how the user will think and act. Thank you again for this oppurtunity.</p>
